Project Title: Pick and Place Robotic Arm using PLC (TIA Portal V18) and Factory I/O

Project Description:
In this automation project, I designed and implemented a Pick and Place Robotic Arm system using Siemens S7-1200 PLC programmed in TIA Portal V18, and simulated the entire process using Factory I/O.

Objective:
To automate the process of placing small objects into large boxes, and transferring the filled boxes using a conveyor system.

System Workflow:
Small objects and empty big boxes arrive on separate conveyors.
A robotic arm picks up the small objects one by one from the small object conveyor.
The robotic arm places each small object into a big box positioned on another conveyor.
After 3 small objects are placed inside a big box:
The filled box automatically moves away from the station.
A new empty box arrives for the next cycle.
The entire sequence is controlled using PLC logic with counters and sensor-based triggers.

Key Features:
Used capacitive and position sensors for object detection and arm movement synchronization.
Developed logic for pick and place sequence, box tracking, and automated replacement using counters and timers.
Integrated and tested logic using Factory I/O, simulating a realistic industrial environment.

Tools & Technologies:
TIA Portal V18 – PLC programming (ladder logic)
Siemens S7-1200 PLC
Factory I/O – 3D simulation of conveyors, sensors, and robotic arm

Skills Gained:
Advanced PLC logic development
Understanding of robotic motion coordination
Synchronization of multi-station conveyor systems
Hands-on experience with industrial simulation environments

This project helped bridge the gap between theoretical automation knowledge and real-world industrial applications, and significantly boosted my confidence in PLC-controlled robotic systems.
